# TA1a-Step 1: Create a class "Dog"

    # TA1a-Step 2: Add the two properties to the 'Dog' class using variables.



    # TA1c-Step 1: Initialise the instance variables through a constructor.
    
    
    
    
    # TA1a-Step 3: Add the two methods "run()" and "bark()" inside the 'Dog' class.





      
# TA1a-Step 4: Create an instance or object of the 'Dog' class. Name them as 'tommy', 'scooby', 'dodo' 




# TA1b-Step 1: Access the properties and methods of 'tommy'
# 1. Print all properties of the 'tommy' object.


# 2. Print the value returned by the 'run()' function of 'tommy'.

# 3. Print the value returned by the 'bark()' function  of 'tommy'.
print("-------------------")
# TA1b-Step 2: Access the properties and methods of 'dodo'
# 1. Print all properties of the 'dodo' object.


# 2. Print the value returned by the 'run()' function  of 'dodo'.

# 3. Print the value returned by the 'bark()' function  of 'dodo'.

# NOTE: Before coding for TA1c- Step 2: erase everything from TA1b-Step 1 to TA1b-Step 2 i.e. lines 24 to 39.
#       and define the 'dog1' object by passing instance variable values.
# TA1c- Step 2: Create an object 'dog1' of class "Dog" and enter the values as 'Tommy', 'Labrador' inside the bracket.

# 1. Print the name of 'dog1' object function.

# 2. Print the breed of 'dog1' object function.

# 3. Print the owner and tail property values.


# 4. Print the value returned by the 'run()' function of 'tommy'.

# 5. Print the value returned by the 'bark()' function  of 'tommy'.
